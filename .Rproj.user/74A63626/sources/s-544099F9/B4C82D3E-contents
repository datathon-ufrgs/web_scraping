## Professional Experience

The first time when I heard something about statistics was when I was working as _Agente Censitário Supervisor_ at
[IBGE](ibge.gov.br) in the 2010 Census. My boss was a statistician and he introduced me to the profession.
I enjoyed the idea of “ playing in everyone’s backyard. ” (Tukey). I quit my job and started my undergraduate 
degree in statistics at the [Universidade Federal do 
Rio Grande do Sul - UFRGS](ufrgs.br), one of the best universities in my country.   
Soon after I got involved in a research project at the Department of Social Medicine called [Saúde Urbana](http://www.ufrgs.br/saudeurbana)
as a recipient of a Scientific Initiation Scholarship. This work put in contact with spatial statistics
in an applied setting. In my last two years as undegraduate student, I worked at [NAE](http://www.mat.ufrgs.br/~nae/) 
with statistical consulting in academic projects and at
[AMBES](http://portais4.ufes.br/prppg/ext/projetos.php?prog=30001013031P8&cdproj=3890), an environmental 
characterization of the Espírito Santos Basin, a project financially supported by the state 
owned petroleum company Petrobras, with geostatistical models to invesigate physical and 
chemical properties of water near to oil platforms.   
After completing my degree, I worked on an information technology company, called [CONECTT](https://conectt.com.br/), 
with analysis of web data and predictive modeling. It was an enriching experience where I improved my team work and
programming skills. This work showed that I needed, and wanted, more knowledge. I applied for a Master Degree in 
Statistics at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - UFMG, one the best graduate programs in Brazil. Upon acceptance, 
I started in March 2017. I have been carrying out research under the supervision of Dr. Renato Assuncção. We are 
developing a Monte Carlo test to test if two sets of polygons have some kind of spatial association. This work was
motivated by a request from researchers at [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home), the ArcGIS company.  
I also participate as a coordinator of a research group of graduate students at UFMG called 
[Stats4Good](stats4good.github.io), where the main goal is using statistics to contribute for a better society. 
This group has two projects, one that is called [GESEM](stats4good.github.io/gesem) about under reporting of rape 
in Brazil, and another one called [Veraz](stats4good.github.io/veraz) about the public sector expenses in the same country.
I am part of the second one, and we have a lot of visualizations and insights about the data. Currently we are working 
on a Shiny App to show the population how the governors are using the money collected from taxes. There are another 
project that I participated where I and three colleagues won an challenge called 1st CEPESP Data Challenge: Deciphering
Brazil Elections. The main goal of this challenge was to find solutions for visualization, search engines,
graphic arts and any other tools that facilitate the understanding of the electoral process
in Brazil, always with free and open source software, our app can be accessed throud this
